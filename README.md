# NootBot

A Discord automation/soundboard bot written in Java using Spring Boot.

Much of the foundation code was taken from an early commit of [Darkside138/DiscordSoundboard](https://github.com/Darkside138/DiscordSoundboard) but has since wildly diverged. In the process of a rewrite (albeit, slowly) [in Golang](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Garrus).

*This Java Spring Boot iteration is no longer under active development and is now only maintained in order to keep up to date with Discord changes.*
