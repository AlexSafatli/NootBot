# NootBot

A Discord automation/soundboard bot written in Java using Spring Boot.

Much of the foundation code was taken from an early commit of [Darkside138/DiscordSoundboard](https://github.com/Darkside138/DiscordSoundboard) but has since wildly diverged. Now mostly rewritten [in Golang](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Garrus).

*This Java Spring Boot iteration is no longer under active development and is no longer maintained in order to keep up to date with Discord changes. It has been replaced by the Golang replacement linked to above.*
